General business trends (think national and even international) are great article fodder, too.\n\nMission statements – You can tell a lot about a company by its mission statement. Don’t have one? Now might be a good time to create one and post it here. A good mission statement tells you what drives a company to do what it does.\n\nCompany policies – Are there company policies that are particularly important to your business? Perhaps your unlimited paternity\u002Fmaternity leave policy has endeared you to employees across the company. This is a good place to talk about that.\n\nExecutive profiles – A company is only as strong as its executive leadership. This is a good place to show off who’s occupying the corner offices.
